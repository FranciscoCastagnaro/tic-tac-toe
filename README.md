# Hi there!👋
============

This is a proyect i started in order to try to learn various things i wanted to.
The stack is `React + Vite`, to make the UI: the `Shadcn/UI` library which i really liked using!

*Disclaimer :D*
 _At the beginning of this repository i was not even familiar with the using of TypeScript, so if there is some rare things, thats why ☺️ (im learning it yet, its really interesting)_
